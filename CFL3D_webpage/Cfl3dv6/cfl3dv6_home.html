<p><strong><h>Welcome to the CFL3D Version 6 Home Page!</h>
</center></strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>CFL3D
is a structured-grid, cell-centered, upwind-biased, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code. It can be run
in parallel on multiple grid zones with point-matched, patched, overset, or embedded connectivities. Both
multigrid and mesh sequencing are available in time-accurate or steady-state modes.</strong>

<p>CFL3D 
has been used to support numerous NASA programs since the late 1980s. It continues to be used today, particularly
for validation and verification activities such as those documented on the
<a href="https://turbmodels.larc.nasa.gov" target="blank">NASA Langley Turbulence Modeling Resource (TMR) website</a>.
</p>

<p>Two U.S. Postage Stamps, issued in 2006, commemorate X-Planes, a series 
of experimental vehicles involving NASA, the U.S. military, and aerospace companies. The
computer-generated images shown on the stamps were produced from results using the CFL3D code
(computed by the NASA Langley Geometry Laboratory).</p>

<p><a NAME="intro"></a><strong><u>INTRODUCTION</u></strong>

<p>These pages provide the documentation for the newest version of <strong>CFL3D</strong>,
<strong>Version 6.7</strong>. CFL3D is a long-standing Navier-Stokes CFD code 
developed at NASA Langley Research Center for solving 2-D or
3-D flows on structured grids. The code has been in existence since the
late 1980's, is very reliable and stable, and has many
capabilities and options. We invite you to start off by perusing the Test Cases and
Image Gallery, by clicking on the buttons to the left.

<p><strong>Version 6.7</strong> (released on February 1, 2017) represents only relatively minor upgrades
over <strong>Version 6.6</strong> (released on April 14, 2011). Most of the changes
reflect minor bug fixes or new capabilities, particularly with respect to several new
keyword input capabilities.  See
<a href="cfl3dv6_new.html">New Features</a> for details on these.

<p>There is no formal User's manual available for Version 6, but
there is a manual for Version 5 and virtually all
of this documentation is also applicable to Version 6.
There are many options in V6 that were not available in V5, and a few that are
handled slightly differently. Usage of these new options is described in
<a href="cfl3dv6_new.html">New Features</a>.
You may download a pdf file of the Version 5 User's Manual 
(either by chapter or in total) 
by clicking on the "Version 5 Manual" selection in the index to the left.

<!--<p>CFL3Dv6 has the same functionality as CFL3Dv5, with the added ability of
parallel execution. Although the restart file for Version 6 differs from
that of Version 5 (and from the Beta Version 6), Version 5 / Beta Version 6
restart files are readable by use of the 
<a href="cfl3dv6_new.html#keyword">keyword</a> "irghost".
With few <a href="cfl3dv6_new.html#diffs">exceptions</a>,
input file formats are exactly the same for the two versions.</p>
-->

<!--<p>
A new GUI for PAB3D, CFL3D and TLNS3D has been developed by Analytical Services & 
Materials, Inc., and is available to NASA and its contractors.
From the release announcement:

<ul>
<pre>
"Large and small companies, research organizations and educational
institutions are increasingly using CFD codes. The Unified Process
Management System (UPMS) provide a valuable tool for the use of NASA's
CFD codes. Each of these CFD codes has specific formats for input files.
Simple modifications in problem definition often require extensive
alterations to these formats.  Often, users have to be trained by CFD code
suppliers to enable them to model the problem correctly and to use the
various options available in the code efficiently. It becomes difficult
for a user to be familiar with more than one code.  The Unified Process
Management System was developed in conjunction with NASA under a SBIR
phase II research and development contract." 
</pre>
</ul>

You may wish to try this new tool; the link to the UPMS web site can be found in 
the <a href="#related">Related Web Sites</a> section.

<!--<p><a NAME="are_you_sure">
<p>Before requesting the code, you should consider the following;

<ul>

<p><li type=circle>You will need substantial computing resources, depending of course on the 
size of the problem you are trying to solve.  The code typically requires a Linux cluster 
or "supercomputer" for moderate to large size problems; we provide no support for 
compilation on Windows or Mac OS machines.</li>

<p><li type=circle>You need to provide the code with a 3D volume structured grid. No grid 
generation software is provided with the CFL3D code.  Generally speaking you will need a 
commercial grid generation package as well as postprocessing visualization tools
(see <a href="#prepost">Grid Generators and Post-Processors</a>).
And you need to be proficient 
enough with the grid generation package to know how to create high-quality grids.</li>

<p><li type=circle>As with all general capability CFD codes, there is a fairly steep 
learning curve to CFL3D; prior experience in CFD is helpful.</li>

</ul>-->

<p><a NAME="backgrnd"></a><strong><u>MORE ABOUT VERSION 6</u></strong>

<p><strong>CFL3Dv6</strong> can be run in either the standard (sequential) mode or in distributed/
parallel mode. Whereas in the sequential mode all blocks at all multigrid levels
reside on one processor, in the distributed/parallel mode each processor will 
have one or more grid blocks residing on it. The coarser levels required for 
multigrid reside on the same processor as the finer parent block. The 
computations for a particular grid block are not currently 
split among multiple processors. As a result, <strong>single-block grids
cannot be run in parallel</strong>. However, a <a href="cfl3dv6_splitter.html">
Block Splitter</a> tool is provided to facilitate conversion
of an existing grid and input file to run in a parallel environment.

<p>The parallel code utilizes the Message Passing Interface <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi">(MPI)</a>. The required MPI
libraries may be "native" ones that exist on parallel processors such as the
Origin 2000, the SP2 or the T3E, or, for workstation clusters, the portable MPI
implementation, <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/index.html">MPICH</a>.</p>

<p>The code displays reasonably good scalability with increasing
processor count for load balanced cases. Scaling tests have been conducted on
<a href="Gifs/o2k.gif">SGI Origin 2000</a>,
<a href="Gifs/t3e.gif">CRAY T3E</a>,
and <a href="Gifs/beowulf.gif">"Beowulf" Pentium</a> systems.


<!--<p>Initial development of <strong>CFL3dv6</strong> was done under contract to Computer Sciences
Corporation, with Jerry Mall carrying out the initial port of Version 5.0
to MPI. The basic structure of the code was modeled after the earlier parallel
version, <strong>CFL3Dv4.1hp</strong>. After the code was passed back to NASA, additional
modifications were made to implement the full range of features available in
the standard release of Version 5.0, as well as to add the additional features
that are described within this document.

<p>Along the way P. Sundaram and collegues at Boeing Phantom Works-Long Beach
made significant contributions by aggressive application of the parallel code.
James Hager of BPW-LB provided a number of helpful suggestions for improvement.
Thomas Faulkner of MRJ Technology Solutions has done extensive benchmarking of
the earlier <strong>CFL3DV4.1hp</strong> on the NAS Origin 2000 and NAS Whitney
cluster and provided valuable feedback on code performance.</p>-->

<p><a NAME="prepost"></a><strong><u>GRID GENERATORS AND POST-PROCESSORS</u></strong>

<p>
CFL3D does not include grid generation capability; a separate grid generator must
be obtained.  CFL3D can work with grids in any one of 3 formats:
CGNS, PLOT3D, or CFL3D.  

<p>
CFL3D also does not provide postprocessing visualization
tools.  For output, the code can create results in two widely-used
formats:  CGNS and/or PLOT3D (there is also some limited Tecplot output capability).
