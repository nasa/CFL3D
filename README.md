## CFL3D

CFL3D 
is a structured-grid, cell-centered, upwind-biased, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code. It can be run
in parallel on multiple grid zones with point-matched, patched, overset, or embedded connectivities. Both
multigrid and mesh sequencing are available in time-accurate or steady-state modes.

## About the CMake branch
As a practice of cmake, I had ported the make system of cfl3d to CMake, a modern industry-level build system. Which is much more easy to use, understand, modify and maintain.

Now the CMake branch has been merged into master, you can download the original `Intall and makefile build system` version using:
```shell
git clone --depth=1 --branch v6.7_gfortran_openmpi https://github.com/chengdi123000/cfl3d.git
```

### Compilation
```shell
## prerequirement (tested in Ubuntu 16.04)
sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev gfortran build-essential git cmake -y
# in RHEL/CentOS, you may try this:
# sudo yum install openmpi-devel gcc gcc-gfortran git cmake

## download  
git clone https://git.coding.net/chengdi123000/CFL3D.git

## manually build cgns 2.5 without hdf5 and mpi
# you can also use your own cgns library if you put your cgnslib_f.h and libcgns.a in /usr/share/include and /usr/share/lib respectively
cd CFL3D/external/cgns
./build_cgns

## build cfl3d executables out of source
cd ../../build
cmake ..
make
# or you may benefit from parallel run, try:
# make -j`nproc`
# There will be a lot of warnings because I do not turn off all warnings as the original CFL3D build system do.
```

### Test
First set the PATH
```shell
## When completed, the executables will be in CFL3D/build/bin directory.
# suggest to use this line of script to add executables to PATH
# export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
# You can use following line of script to add a command `use_cfl3d` to load executables ready to run after re-login
# echo "alias use_cfl3d='export PATH=$PWD/bin:\$PATH'">>$HOME/.bashrc
```
Then you need to download testcases
```shell
cd CFL3D/testcase
./download_testcases #wget is needed.
cd cfl3d.larc.nasa.gov/Cfl3dv6/2DTestcases/Flatplate
tar xvf Flatplate.tar.Z
# use_cfl3d
splitter < split.inp_1blk 
cfl3d_seq < grdflat5.inp &
tail -f cfl3d.out #monitor the steps and residuals
```
